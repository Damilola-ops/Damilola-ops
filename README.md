### Hi there 👋, I'm Damilola

#### Software Engineering and Machine Learning. 

I'm a machine learning engineer with broad-ranging interests in machine learning ranging from natural language processing to reinforcement learning. 

I'm currently working on a side project [Zeno](https://zeeno.vercel.app). An app that lets you find books about a given text description. </h2>

I recently wrote a blog post about [byte pair encoding](https://medium.com/@oduguwadamilola40/byte-pair-encoding-the-tokenization-algorithm-powering-large-language-models-5055fbdc0153)

My projects and blog posts  can be found on my [portfolio website](https://damilojohn.github.io/)

Currently contributing at [Ivy](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy) and helping to build a transpilation engine for transpiling code between deep learning frameworks.


<h2 >Some things about me...</h2>
- 🌱 I’m learning about Deep Reinforcement Learning  and optimizing transformers during training and inference. <br><br> 
-  🎨 I play football and learn about Art, Astronomy, Biology, History, and Music in my free time.
